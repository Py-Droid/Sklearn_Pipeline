> Machine learning (ML) pipelines consist of several steps to train a model.

## A machine learning pipeline would consist of the following processes:

- Data collection
- Data cleaning
- Feature extraction (labelling and dimensionality reduction)
- Model validation
- Visualisation

Data collection and cleaning are the primary tasks of any machine learning Pipeline.
